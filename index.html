        Carbon emissions are an extreme problem in our environment; there are millions of ways that they affect our society. We wanted to focus on an industry that has been rising for the past few decades: the technology industry. With websites such as Youtube getting billions of views, and being utilized for education, entertainment, leisure, as well as connection, we find it concerning and surprising how much carbon usage and emissions that come from websites and electronics are overlooked. We wanted to provide a space where we raise awareness about that, as well as explaining how to reduce the carbon footprint through devices and websites. So next time you mindlessly scroll on your phone, youâ€™ll have the satisfaction of helping the environment.
